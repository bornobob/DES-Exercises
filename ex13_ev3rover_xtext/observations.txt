Observations:
    
    In the case of multiple errors or warnings, it seems like the Validator sometimes gets caught up and does a
    validation check at an incorrect place. Unfortunately, we have not yet found out how to fix this. 
    
    Due to the nature of our Robot codebase, a Robot needs a driveAction to do something at all, as a sort of 
    default. This is not implemented in the grammar yet, but is a relatively easy extension (given some time).
    
    We have not yet found a proper way to work around the automatic newlines Xtend adds when calling a new
    generator function. Putting the whole function on one line works, but that is unreadable.
    
    Our grammer currently supports defining multiple robots, but the code generation does not (yet). This is 
    something we would like to extend to soon (including bluetooth support).
    
Description:
    
    Our DSL generates errors for when two different missions share the same name, and likewise for robots.
    It also gives an error when a robot has a non-valid mission and when the arguments are invalid for the 
    action to which they are bound. Lastly, it gives a warning when two missions with different names 
    have the exact same actions, warning the user for duplication.
