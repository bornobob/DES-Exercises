Description:
    In short, our structure contains a Robot, Runner and Actions. A runner takes a Robot and a list of Actions, and
    executes the Actions in order of their priority. The Actions we have are the Borderaction (which detects black
    borders), the Collisionaction (which detects collision with the ball) and the Ultrasoundaction, which tries to
    prevent collisions with the ball. Finally, "main.py" is used to execute this all.


Observations:
    If the Robot is working on an action and then breaks an invariant (like never crossing a black border), then
    regardless of priority it will finish its current action, possibly causing the Robot to ignore black borders.
    This happens for example when the Robot is driving, encounters a black border and starts speaking, and while
    speaking crosses another black border. In this example case the speaking signal is blocking, and thus the robot
    cannot perform any checks on its invariants.

    It might be important to note that we used ev3dev2simulator instead of the real Robot.
